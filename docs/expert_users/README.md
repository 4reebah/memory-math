# Building The Project

## Front-end: 
1. Open the terminal and clone the repository: https://github.com/4reebah/memory-math.git
2. Navigate to to the cloned project and navigate to dev/frontend.
3. Once in the folder, run npm i.
4. Then, run npm start.
5. Go to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the front-end.

## Back-end: 
1. Open the terminal and clone the repository: https://github.com/4reebah/memory-math.git
2. Navigate to to the cloned project and navigate to dev/backend.
3. Install Dependencies: pip3 install -r requirements.txt. If there is an error with installing any of the dependencies, try removing the version from the requirements.txt file. If that doesn't work, try removing the dependency from the requirements.txt file all together. 
4. Once in the folder, run python3 server.py.
5. Go to http://localhost:5000 to interact with the back-end.

## Optional Steps: Use the Back-end with a Virtual Environment
1. Run python3 -m venv venv in the backend folder
2. Navigate to source venv/bin/activate.
3. Run the installation command: pip3 install -r requirements.txt. If there is an error with installing any of the dependencies, try removing the version from the requirements.txt file. If that doesn't work, try removing the dependency from the requirements.txt file all together. 
5. Go to http://localhost:5000 to interact with the back-end.
